I have been a Solutions Architect and Software Engineer at Databricks and an academic researcher,
all in various parts of the Machine Learning and advanced analytics space.

### Summary of work

I am an [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) committer and PMC member working at [Databricks](https://databricks.com/),
the company founded by the original creators of Spark, [Delta Lake](https://delta.io/), and [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/).
I spent my first 5.5 years at Databricks leading some of our ML efforts from the engineering side, and I am now an
ML specialist in the Solutions Architect organization.

Previously, I spent a year as a postdoc working with [Kannan Ramchandran](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kannanr/)
and [Martin Wainwright](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wainwrig/) at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/).
I received my [Ph.D. in Machine Learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) from Carnegie Mellon University,
where I worked with [Carlos Guestrin](https://guestrin.su.domains/).
I received my B.S.E. in Computer Science from [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/),
where I did research with [Robert E. Schapire](http://rob.schapire.net/).

### Talks, blogs, etc. while at Databricks

### Open source work

, including those around Spark MLlib,
[GraphFrames](https://graphframes.github.io/graphframes/docs/_site/index.html) 

My open source work can be found most easily by looking at:

Github for activity, especially within open source Apache Spark or Spark Packages
Databricks' Slideshare page or Spark Summit records for slides and talks
Databricks blog posts which I occasionally write
